# ISELP for Everyone

The idea behind this website was to provide a more digestable way to intake the information from the rather lengthly [ISELP Programming Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19JGCfusp80INEaoEr3Kflopd67AFguzkGtJh-I2Y7Lg/edit?usp=sharing) document.

Over weeks of planning, designing, and programming, the project was sculpted from the ground up. This was made possible by the vision and support from Mr. Lyle, a resource teacher, who led the project from start to finish.

The website was designed with Figma, then written in TypeScript with Next.js and Tailwind CSS.
